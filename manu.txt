The sky reflects a soft, pale hue,
As dusk descends with shades of blue.
And in the quiet of the night,
Stars twinkle softly, pure and bright.
Let dreams take flight on wings of air,
For beauty lingers everywhere.
In nature's arms, we find our peace,
A timeless love that will not cease.

On fields of green, he shines so bright,
A force of nature, a glorious sight.
With every step, a world in awe,
The king of football, breaking every law.

From Madeira's shores, he took his flight,
A boy with dreams that reached new heights.
Through grit and grace, he made his name,
A legacy built on skill and fame.

With eyes of fire, he chases goals,
His heart beats loud, his spirit bold.
From Manchester’s roar to Madrid’s flame,
Every victory echoes his name.

A master of speed, of power, of mind,
In every match, he's one of a kind.
With each precise strike, the crowd will cheer,
For the legend they watch, year after year.
